# Notes on Statistics and Machine Learning

This repository contains tutorials and articles on various topics in statistics and machine learning. The selection of topics follows no specific pattern. Often, I come across an interesting idea in a paper, which leads me to explore it further by consulting additional sources and taking notes.

Previously, my notes were mostly handwritten and lacked structure. This repository is an effort to change that. The content is primarily provided as Jupyter Notebooks (possibly in other formats in the future) and includes mainly theoretical discussions, often accompanied by code to make the concepts more tangible.
